# Hi there 👋, I'm Aditya

## Things I've Built

**CampusNest**: Full-stack housing platform that solves the "where do I live" problem for students. Real-time roommate matching with lifestyle filters, integrated MapBox for location pinning, WebSockets for live chat, and AWS deployment with 80%+ test coverage. Because finding housing shouldn't feel like a second job.

**Workboard**: Digital Kanban board with drag-and-drop, role-based access, and real-time multi-user sync via WebSockets. JWT-secured REST APIs because your tasks deserve better security than your average todo app.

**Geo-Tagging System**: GPS tracking app for wildlife monitoring with MQTT integration and YOLO-based threat detection. Deployed on Heroku, generates Excel reports, shows animal density hotspots. Built for forest officers who need real-time intel, not spreadsheets.

**Blockchain Credentials**: Academic certificate platform using Ethereum hashing via Web3j and IPFS storage. Because fake degrees should be impossible to forge.

## Things that I'm learning currently

Deep-diving into distributed systems and cloud architecture - scaling applications properly is underrated
Optimizing CI/CD pipelines and hitting that sweet spot between test coverage and deployment speed
Exploring real-time communication patterns with WebSockets because async is life

## Tech-Stack I Have worked on
React.js, Spring boot, Django, MySQL, PostgreSQL, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, S3), WebSockets, Travis CI, Docker
Looking for full-time SWE opportunities for Spring & Summer 2026 | MS CS @ NYU Tandon (May 2026) | Previously @ Tata Consultancy Services
